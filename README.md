# ðŸ’¡ Real-Time Object Detection & Smart Lighting

A real-time lighting control system that uses computer vision and environmental context to dynamically control DMX lighting. Designed for interactive spaces where lighting reacts to human presence and time of day.

## Features

- Real-time object tracking using Intel RealSense RGB camera
- Adaptive lighting based on sun position (via Astral)
- Motion-triggered light responses across 3 screen zones
- GPIO-connected button for immediate light override (DMX blackout)
- DMX output over Art-Net protocol
